# UK Biobank Data Parser
#### Contact: Alyssa Zhu <alyssahz@usc.edu>

The UK Biobank Data Parser (**ukbb_parser**) is a python-based package that allows easy interfacing with the large UK Biobank dataset (Zhu et al., OHBM 2019).

To avoid repetitive calls for standard demographic variables, we created default output columns for sex, age at the time of the neuroimaging scan, race/ethnicity, and education. Race (Data-Field 21000) is coded first by the larger race group due to inconsistent reporting of ethnicity. Education (Data-Field 6138) is coded according to educational levels in the United Kingdom. These levels are converted to standardized education levels based on the International Standard Classification of Education framework, and estimated years of education is derived using the conversion strategy published by Okbay et al. (2016).

## Requirements

Please note that this parser uses the Click package, which is not yet available for Python 3.7. Any Python version <=3.6 will be compatible.

## Installation 

Two-step process:
1. To clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/USC-IGC/ukbb_parser.git`

2. After downloading or cloning (in the same directory that `git clone` was run in):
`pip install ukbb_parser`

One-step process:
`pip install git+https://github.com/USC-IGC/ukbb_parser.git`

N.B. The above installation commands will require administrator/root privileges of the system. If you don't have administrator/root privileges, please try adding the `--user` flag.

Example:
`pip install --user ukbb_parser`

## Subcommands

### parse

The **parse** subcommand will filter the input CSV file with the given input parameters.
The output csv will contain a set of default columns: eid, age at visits, race, education levels, healthy control cohorts (see output HTML for more details), and sex.

Required Inputs:
* `-i, --incsv CSV`          File path of the downloaded UK Biobank data csv
* `-o, --out TEXT`           Output prefix

Optional Inputs:
* `--incon ICD10Code`        ICD10 Diagnosis codes you wish to include. Least 
                           common denominators are acceptable, e.g. --incon F. 
                           Ranges are also acceptable inputs. Please include 
                           chapters for both ends, e.g. F10-F20
* `--excon ICD10Code`        ICD10 Diagnosis codes you wish to exclude. Least 
                           common denominators are acceptable, e.g. --incon F. 
                           Ranges are also acceptable inputs. Please include 
                           chapters for both ends, e.g. F10-F20
* `--insr SRCode`            Self-Report codes you wish to include. Ranges are
                           acceptable inputs.
* `--exsr SRCode`            Self-Report codes you wish to exclude. Ranges are
                           acceptable inputs.
* `--incat Category`         Categories you wish to include. Ranges are
                           acceptable inputs, e.g. 100-200
* `--excat Category`         Categories you wish to exclude. Ranges are
                           acceptable inputs, e.g. 100-200
* `--inhdr HeaderName`       Columns names you wish to include. Ranges are
                           acceptable inputs, e.g. 100-200
                           If you wish to have
                           all the available data, please use --inhdr all
* `--exhdr HeaderName`       Columns names you wish to exclude. Ranges are
                           acceptable inputs, e.g. 100-200
* `--subjects SubID`         A list of participant IDs to include
* `--dropouts dropouts`      CSV(s) containing eids of participants who have
                           dropped out of the study
* `--icd10_count ICD10Code`  Create a binary column for the specified ICD10
                           conditions only. Ranges can cross consecutive
                           letters, e.g. A00-B99. Ranges within a letter
                           should be specified, A00-A99. A single letter will
                           create a binary column for that group of diseases.
                           Give the input as 'all' to create a column for
                           every self-report condition
* `--sr_count SRCode`        Create a binary column for the specified self-
                           report conditions only. Ranges are acceptable
                           inputs. Give the input as 'all' to create a column
                           for every self-report condition
* `--img_subs_only`          Use this flag to only keep data of participants
                           with an imaging visit.
* `--img_visit_only`         Use this flag to only keep data acquired during the
                           imaging visit.
* `--fillna TEXT`            Use this flag to fill blank cells with the flag
                           input, e.g., NA
* `--combine Spreadsheet`    Spreadsheets to combine to output; Please make sure
                           all spreadsheets have an identifier column 'eid'

The incon/excon/insr/exsr/incat/excat/inhdr/exhdr/combine flags can all be used multiple times, e.g., `--incat 110 --incat 134`.

Example usage:

ukbb_parser parse --incsv ukbb_spreadsheet.csv -o ukbb_subset --incat 100 --excat 135 --incon G35
