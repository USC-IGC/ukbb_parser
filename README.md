# UK Biobank Data Parser
#### Contact: Alyssa Zhu <alyssahz@usc.edu>

The UK Biobank Data Parser (**ukbb_parser**) is a python-based package that allows easy interfacing with the large UK Biobank dataset (Zhu et al., OHBM 2019).

To avoid repetitive calls for standard demographic variables, we created default output columns for sex, age at the time of the neuroimaging scan, race/ethnicity, and education. Race (Data-Field 21000) is coded first by the larger race group due to inconsistent reporting of ethnicity. Education (Data-Field 6138) is coded according to educational levels in the United Kingdom. These levels are converted to standardized education levels based on the International Standard Classification of Education framework, and estimated years of education is derived using the conversion strategy published by Okbay et al. (2016).

## Requirements

Please note that this parser uses the Click package, which sometimes has problems installing with Python 3.7. Any Python version <=3.6 will be compatible.

## Installation 

As this package has not been added to PyPI, please follow the instructions below carefully.

Two-step process:
1. To clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/USC-IGC/ukbb_parser.git`

2. After downloading or cloning (in the same directory that `git clone` was run in):

### inventory

The **inventory** subcommand will create binary columns indicating the presence of specified data. The data that can be inventoried are _ICD-10 conditions, self-report (non-cancer) conditions, and careers_. 

As can be viewed on [the UK Biobank data showcase](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/index.cgi), these data are organized in a hierarchical tree structure with five levels. At the end of each of the branches are selectable codes, i.e., codes that are used in and can be queried for in the UK Biobank data spreadsheet. By default, the **inventory** subcommand will aggregate all selectable codes within the requested level/code input into a single binary column. To obtain a column for the aggregate column _and_ an additional column for each of the selectable codes within the requested level/code combination, please use `--all_codes`. All selectable codes regardless of level can also be obtained using `--level S --code all`.

Code inputs should be derived from the datafield-specific coding pages available on the UK Biobank showcase. If there are spaces in the codes, please use quotes around the entry (see example below). Multiple levels and codes can be used at once, but please ensure that levels and codes are provided in corresponding pairs.

#### ICD-10 

The coding tree for the ICD-10 conditions can be viewed in part on the pages of either of the datafields ([41202](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=41202) and [41204](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=41204)) or on the [coding page](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/coding.cgi?id=19).

_Notes_
* For top level codes (`--level 0`), use the chapter number as the `--code` input, e.g., "Chapter II" to indicate "Neoplasms".
* For Level 1 (`--level 1`), add "Block" to the beginning of the `--code` input, e.g., "Block A00-09" to indicate "Intestinal infectious diseases"

#### Self-Report (non-cancer)

The coding tree for the self-report (non-cancer) conditions can be viewed on [the datafield page](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=20002) or on the [coding page](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/coding.cgi?id=6).

_Notes_
* As can be seen on the coding page, the upper levels of the self-report conditions have non-unique codes (-1). Please use the "Meaning" as the `--code` input instead. 

#### Careers

The coding tree for careers can be viewed on the datafield pages ([132](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=132) and [22617](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=22617)) or on the [coding page](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/coding.cgi?id=2). Please note that the coding on the coding page is only available to logged-in users.

Also note that this inventory binarization only produces one column per job code, i.e., a job code will be noted as present so long as it has been indicated in any of the visits/instances.

##### Flags and Usage

Inputs:
* `--incsv CSV`      File path of downloaded UK Biobank CSV
* `--outcsv CSV`     File path to write out to
* `--datatype type`  Data to inventory; Valid choices include: icd10,
                    self_report, careers
* `--level level`    Level to inventory by; N.B. Please input 0 for the Top
                    level or S for selectable codes
* `--code code`      Codes to inventory; Use the option 'all' to inventory all
                    categories in the given level; Please use level-appropriate
                    codes; Ranges are allowed for selectable codes
* `--all_codes`      (optional) Use this flag if you'd like to additionally obtain
                   individual inventories of all codes

`ukbb_parser update --previous ukbb_2018_spreadsheet.csv --new ukbb_2019_spreadsheet.csv --outcsv combined_ukbb_2018_2019_spreadsheet.csv`

### check

The **check** subcommand will determine if the queried Datafield is included in the downloaded CSV file.

Inputs:
* `--incsv CSV`     File path of downloaded UK Biobank CSV
* `--datafield df`  Datafield to check for

Example usage:

`ukbb_parser check --incsv ukbb_spreadsheet.csv --datafield 31`
